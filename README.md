# Advent-Of-Code
[My](https://www.github.com/tommie1236) solutions and explainations for the questsions of the Advent of Code event.  

I will try to put my solution for the next question once a day. So if you miss the solution to a day you can come back later or request a specific day for me to solve and explain next

I personaly like python the most so all of this is written in python. If you don't want to work with python you can still look at my way of solving the problem and implement it in your language of choice.
